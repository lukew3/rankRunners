# In the future I plan to make these changes:

## Critical changes
* Make the app work with any number of runners that are needed
* Convert the pr times column into a string so that I won't have to add a minutes and seconds column
* Be able to choose the file that you want to convert from the terminal instead of through the code editor

## Size and Ease of Readability Changees
* Use functions for repeating code
